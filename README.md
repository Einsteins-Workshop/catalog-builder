# Catalog Builder

This script builds the content for our [catalog page](https://www.einsteinsworkshop.com/classes-top/class-catalog)
from data extracted from our Master spreadsheet using vanilla Python 3.

We will try to keep the catalog page synced here.

- [ ] TODO: set up Github Actions so the catalog gets rebuilt on every successful push.
