<p>Welcome to the Einstein's Workshop school year catalog. Here you will find brief descriptions of the classes we are running this 2021-22 school year.</p>
<p>Our classes are divided into four categories. The categories exist to assist you in understanding what the core concept of the class is. Most of our classes are inherently interdisciplinary and use many tools. For more information please do not hesitate to contact us!</p>

<p style="margin: 0;">Coding at Einstein's Workshop is all about gaining confidence and solving problems. At the youngest ages students will play games with other students, learn how to program robots and begin internalizing the language of sequential code. Through the middle school years students will learn primarily though "Block Based Coding" - a computer based system of programming which uses preprogrammed "blocks" of code. Through Block Based Coding students can learn the language of code and make great programs without the nuances of punctuation and syntax which can so easily break their code. In high school students will begin programming in languages such as JAVA and Python to create small games, programs and even their own Minecraft Mods.</p>
